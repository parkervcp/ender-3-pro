# Marlin Config

In the Configuration and Configuration_adv files I have noted changes with P-EDIT.

The Config files are in the `Marlin` folder.

These are based on the Marlin Configurations for the [Ender 3 pro](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3%20Pro/BigTreeTech%20SKR%20Mini%20E3%203.0)
